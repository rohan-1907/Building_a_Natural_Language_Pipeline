we have to make several different choices when we are building an NLP pipeline.

In this notebook I am going to classify the data on disaster tweets using a mix of everything that we have to use while making NLP model - I will check the performance of a model for several choices that can be done (stemming, stop words, number of dimensions in the text presentation array, etc.).

This will enable us to compare between multiple models and select the best one in terms of balance between performance and overfit.
